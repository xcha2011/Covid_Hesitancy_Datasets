# Covid_Hesitancy_Datasets

These data sets are based off of [data from the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/hhp/hhp28.html) and reformated to be more machine readable. <br/> <br/>I condensed the multiple tabs that originally were used to specify the state into a single sheet, removed the whitespace, and changed the names of some of columns so that no two columns had the same name.
