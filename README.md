# Covid_Hesitancy_Datasets

These data sets are based off of [data from the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/hhp/hhp28.html) and reformated to be more machine readable. <br/> <br/>I condensed the multiple tabs into a single sheet, added a column to specify which state each row of data was collected from, removed some whitespace, and changed the names of some of columns so that no two columns had the same name.
